ABOUT ME
=========

# My Name is David York

Family
---------

My family and I live in Sugar City, Idaho with five members in total. There is me, my wife, our 5 year-old daughter, and 17 month-old twins. 
We love being outdoors, yet hate the snow. 

Hobbies
--------

I like to read, listen to music, and play games. My favorite genre of books are fantasy and sci-fi. I like dubstep, and when I'm reading or doing something more calm I prefer chillstep. 
Lastly, my favorite video game series are Halo, Dragon Age, and Monster Hunter.
